[laughter] I know if I pull this, that the fear is so strong that it's about ready to manifest. [unintelligible]. That's why when I pull problematic swords, I'm not that worried if I can change them. I'm still up here on the mental. It just depends which of those swords. If I pull futility then I know I'm either going to go down into confusion or self-cruelty, putting myself down [unintelligible]. I know that at futility I can bounce back into this whole other board and I don't need to go into this whole downward spiral.\n\nIf I pull a negative cup, I know I've got some reaction though, which is going to mean that that negativity has gone to a deeper level. For example, if I pulled the botch on coming indoors then I know that I'm going to this whole terrain. I better start cleaning up my thoughts and my emotional responses before it changes my perspective, my point of view, how I see myself, I see the external situation on how I see other people.\n\nIf I pull stife, frustration, anxiety, and strife, then I know it's not going to be too long before I'm totally oppressed in the situation and then I'll even be worried [unintelligible]. To keep that in mind, there are only three problematic cards on the emotional. If we pull them, it means you go through all six [unintelligible]. There's been some time and investment. It shows you just in consciousness, [unintelligible] that's when you start up all the positive [unintelligible].</html>",

It's a night in air over the water. This is the kind of thinking that when somebody's expressing an idea, they feel so passionate about it, that they convey their determination, their drive. It's the combination of the mental with strong feeling.\n\nThis drive or determination to move forward, it's really mental movement forward. When you pull the Nine of Swords, it literally indicates that mentally you're determined to move forward, go after a certain goal, and the three Salus the body, mind, and spirit. The three Salus are determined to go in the same direction, the left and right sides of the body, the two swords. The long sword on the right side is the dynamic assertive nature of the Salus on the mental level is going forward. The short sword is the magnetically feminine nature is determined to move forward.\n\nThe long sword or anything on the right side of the body is really the dynamic, assertive masculine ability within our nature to start things, execute things, set things into motion, whether we're male or female. The left side, the dagger is an indication of our ability to pinpoint things mentally, the dagger. Whereas the long sword is to cut through things mentally.</html>",

It's uplifted, emotional upliftment on the Knight Of Cups. The first time it barely touches ground is on the perceptional back end. Then all of that consciousness coming to earth is the horse's landing. Now, it's interesting to me that all of the knights internally are growing much bigger than the external. Which goes to the Egyptian philosophy that our inner world and our inner bodies, our inner self, our mental nature, our emotional nature, our perceptual spiritual nature, growing much faster than this body that [unintelligible] physical reality. That's being artistically portrayed there.\n\nThe Knights and the Prince are both on high motion, symbols, the knights are on horses, the prince are on chariots. If I pull a knight or prince, that means new movement. It's motion in consciousness. It's movement forward. Which, to be the hunters in consciousness, indicates I'm moving out in consciousness at that level. I'm going out, I'm being very dynamic on that level. I pull a queen or a princess, they're more frontal. They could be called the warriors or the protectors.
