Your receptivity has the capability of-- what am I…?--of being concrete, of you actually getting work from it, of it becoming concrete. For example, it becoming a book and because it's a discard, of really manifesting it, birthing it. What you might need to do is, just maybe center yourself more and clear your mind, and get a little more into a meditative state when you do this work. Because what happens is that, people get a lot of their energy from the upper chakras, cosmic energy, and they don't get enough of the earth energy. Consequently, they're up here in their head, or in the astral up here, and not enough in the body. Because this is a position of your creativity and your receptivity in this earth, it tells me that you might not be getting enough, either you're getting too much or not enough energy from the earth, that you might need to sit on the grass five minutes every day and get energy from the earth, because we're surrounded by concrete. Yes, you might want to go to the park once in a while and lean on the tree and get energy from the earth.\n\nSG: Good",

It's January.\n\nGA: Or in the month of Virgo. The other thing is that a person with Venus in Virgo or with Venus in Virgo prominent in their chart, or Virgo prominent in their chart, might have a lot to do with-- affect your receptivity and your creativity. You might want to look at your cards.\n\nSG: I have an ascendant. Virgo's ascendant. It's rising.\n\nGA: Ah, okay. Well that might represent you. The three things here are, again, there's three here, three here, and three here, so there's nine. Very balanced. So you have nothing to do but gain from getting into receptive modes and becoming a channel for your creativity.\n\nSG: And the source of that is more often the earth than the head?\n\nGA: In your case, yes. If you had pulled a wand here, that's more like spiritual cosmic energy. If you had pulled a cup, it would be more emotional energy. If you had pulled a sword, that would be more of the idea and the intellectual. Because you pulled an earth, that has more to do with concrete reality, manifesting an earth energy.\n\nSG: Good.

The moon is feminine receptivity, the lunar, the night, and subconscious creativity. They're both joined by the same wand, by the same rod. This means that it's perfectly balanced in you right now. When you make your decisions and when you delegate, pass through other people, do it from a place of strength and of centeredness.\n\nEvery time you think, well, you're going to be swayed off your feet by the demands of someone, think of this card and meditate on this card. It's the sun in Sag, in Sagittarius. That means that you have to be very direct in communicating your orders, your messages. Your communication has to be very direct upfront. Sag is like aiming straight for it. So is the previous card, the Nine of Disks game. They both deal with hitting the mark and aiming directly. It's really amazing that the two sides of nature are balanced.\n\nSG: Really? Does that say they are balanced, or that I must work on balancing, or both?\n\nGA: I think that they are balanced but you have to maintain this balance. You have to maintain it because what you are right now doesn't mean you are tomorrow. Maybe when you meditated it cleared up a lot of stuff for you because you don't seem to have very many problems. There's flames in the background. It would symbolize inspiration, intuition. Then all the little shafts.\n\nSG: Are they shafts or are they--\n\nGA: They're little shafts in the arrow.\n\nSG: Yes, right.\n\nGA: And they're moons. The points are also moons. It just means you're a very strong lady. That strength is your mainstay. That nine months, nine weeks from now, or nine months from now, either one of those, that you might be challenged. A situation will come up to test you to see whether you're going to use strength or not. Just like over here. If you're going to be centered enough. These little tests come periodically. This is to check up on you and see if you're on your path. It could be a person, a Sagittarian person. If it doesn't happen nine weeks from now or nine months from now, it might happen during the time of Sagittarius. Usually, those times will, you'll remember them. You'll remember those events because they leave-- All these dates that I'm giving you, they're going to be there. I've not ever heard of one that hasn't been. [laughs]\n\nSG: Really? Good.",

Again, they're balanced because two and one makes three.\n\nSG: [chuckles]\n\nGA: If you draw a card like the tower, and then you draw the chariot, they're complements of each other. Because six and one makes seven. There are cycles in the tarot, numerologically, in astrology, astrologically, there are definite cycles, and this is one cycle. Okay, what you don't deal with in your Empress energy or year comes up in your hanged man year. Everybody goes through a growth year every year. Jane is going through the 10–What was it that I told you, the Wheel of Fortune?\n\nSG: mmhmm\n\nGA: The growth year that you're going through with-- Okay. Okay, you're going through a two-year, the High Priestess, which is another lesbian card.\n\nSG: mmhmm\n\nGA: In your growth year, what you're trying to do is you're trying to balance your independence. People are making demands on you, and they're not giving you your space. The tendency during that year is to either walk out, withdraw, leave. It's either withdraw or leave. A lot of times you probably are gonna feel like doing that. Yes. Also, it's a year where you get in touch with your intuition and your receptivity.\n\nSG: When is that?

The karma for that year, the two karma, which is my karma, is being attentive to detail, being of service to others, being organized, efficient, and all the things I'm not. [laughs] It's my karma.\n\nSG: You're kidding.\n\nGA: That's the year you're going to have to get on top of that. How much time can you allow? Okay, and here's where the Empress comes in. The Empress is the card, the energy that says, okay, how much am I going to put out? How much am I going to take in? It's the card of giving and receiving. If you overextend, you get in this position, the hangman. If you underextend, the same thing happens. The thing to look for is your love nature. When you give, are you giving out of the goodness of your heart and out of altruistic feelings? Or are you giving like a bargaining, like a merchandising? I'll give you this much if you give me this much. I will love you this much if you love me this much. This is to watch it. You don't make love to a bargain or merchandise. The Empress is the card of symbolizing the fertility of nature. He comes into you. She's sort of like Venus, Aphrodite, that image, love, but also harmony and balance. Let me see. Nurturing. A lot of nurturing. See the little birds down there?\n\nSG: Yes.\n\nGA: Do you think that's a pelican?\n\nSG: I'm not sure, it could be I think. It doesn't have a lot of--\n\nGA: The symbol for the pelican was the mother cutting open her breast to feed her little bird's blood. It was like this nurturing, almost like. You've got to be careful when you get into nurturing.\n\nSG: That's very good advice. Very good.\n\nGA: A lot of green. The green is like fertility, creativity. There are a lot of magnetic lines. Magnetic lines are curved, feminine. Vertical lines are more aggressive, more masculine, dynamic. My teacher Angie Arrien doesn't like to use feminine and masculine, so she uses dynamic and magnetic. It's the same truth.\n\nSG: Dynamic is the masculine thing? isn't that interesting.\n\nGA: Just a lot of curved lines. Look at the way she holds her arms.",

In 10 weeks, you need to get rid of this pattern. So what you do-- Let me tell you about the pattern first. This is the Sun in Gemini. In Gemini's communication in the twins which is very close to the lovers, being pulled in opposite directions. Sun is just awareness. Here you have all these swords. There's 9. I've never been able to find the 10th sword in here. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.\n\nThe swords represent thoughts. Your thoughts are piercing your heart. They're wounding your heart. See the little heart there? With thoughts of ruin, of self-ruin. That has to do with communicating something. Consciously dealing with something. It has to do with the Sun in Gemini. It means that 10 years ago or 10 weeks ago, you were wounded. Probably by somebody else, but you took it up and you beat yourself with it. Situations come up where you think, \"Oh, it's no use. It's futile. It doesn't do any good.\" You do this thought number on yourself.\n\nIf you just will recognize it, that it is just your thoughts. That it is one aspect of yourself and not all of yourself. The hourglass, there's hourglasses here. There's sigils, S-I-G-I-L. They're upside down. Over here is the scales on top. Those are symbols that are pretty much self-explanatory. The hourglass has to do with time. Time running out. You putting a thing on yourself because you didn't do this in time or you didn't do that in time. The scales are like justice and balance and money. It also has to do with money. It's a very simple card. It just means thoughts of self-ruin.",
