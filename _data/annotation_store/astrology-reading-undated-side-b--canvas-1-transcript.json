That part will disappear for a little bit unless it goes retrograde. Let me just check. 20, 21. Yes, it does go retrograde, it does hit 15. What will happen is, okay, November, there'll be a release of energy, but then you'll be working very intensely on this external changing stuff.\n\nThen, coming back in May, you're going to be experiencing a reconnection. Oh, actually that's May. Yes, May of '82, you're going to be experiencing a reconnection to the work issue, and that will continue all of May and all of June, because it just sits on 15, which is your Saturn. It just sits there for the whole month. The whole month of June of 1982, you'll be going through a lot of changes around your work, and around opening up your work, and your power.\n\nThen, it sits for the first couple of weeks in July of '82 as well, and then it passes on, and you're done. The end of July of '82, you're done with that part of your Saturn cycle, but you are still having Saturn through your 12th house. You're still dealing with things externally, and things are still coming up to make you deal with letting go of your limitations, letting go of your negative energy, and that continues until it hits seven degrees of Scorpio, which is not until October of 1983.\n\nYou still have another year after that of dealing with the external stuff. Then, in October of '83, you start having Saturn through your first house, and what this does, Cherrie, is this then forces you to really accept your power. You then, instead of the externals making the changes, you make the changes, and you create your own power.\n\nThe first house is the house of self-identity. You then start accepting power inside of yourself. It's the power to be yourself. You're not going in the closet and looking around for who you're going to be. It's like you just strip off. You're just-- This whole period of time is a stripping off of negative energy. Anything that keeps you from totally being yourself, totally accepting your true power.\n\nThen, that continues until six degrees of Sagittarius, which is, let me just check this. It's retrograde. Yes, let's see. [silence] Until October of 1986, so you can see that this is, as I said-</html>",

The people you're with and what you do, and the things that you experience, and what you dream about, and lovers and friends, everything, all has to connect to that work.\n\nIt's saying that, it's not just for yourself. It's not just so that you can repay karma, or so that you can achieve your destiny, or so that you can evolve. It's not even just for the planet. It's for the whole universe. That's the thing you have to accept, is that you have this divine work to do. You have to be a channel for it. That it's really a scary thing, but it's an absolutely right thing.\n\nIt's also saying that you can only be as good for it as you are inside of yourself. You might have met people who have great reps, and then you meet them and it's like, \"Ugh, this person's a real drag.\" What it is, it's because maybe they can detach themselves. Their personal life can be very different from their political, or their work life, but for you, it's the same.\n\nIt's saying that whoever you are inside, you are outside, and that's why you feel so much pressure, because everything you do, your work, your friends, your lovers, your living situation, the things you think about, the things you dream about, the things you eat, everything connects to who you are and to your destiny, and to your work. That's because of that Pluto energy.\n\nHowever, you also have this south node in Leo.

In that particular way, it was still so in you, you couldn't let it go. That finally, it got to this point where you knew, it was like you had some threats made on you, and you knew that if you went to confront this person, something really bad was going to happen.\n\nAt the same time, it was like you almost accepted it as your fate, even to the point where you went through this real strange thing of saying \"goodbye\" in a really special way to your kids. It's like you knew, it was like you really knew you were going to die, but at the same time, it's like you wouldn't consciously accept it. You just went through this thing, and you went to confront this person, and this really incredibly disgusting person.\n\nIt was like, \"Oh, we're going to teach this little woman a lesson.\" It was almost like all they meant to do was rough you up, and the next thing you knew, they were murdering you. It was like this really incredible thing. You were just attacked by all these men. It was this incredibly horrible, horrible experience for you, but at the same time, in a way, it was less horrible than it might have been, because you immediately left your body.\n\nIt was like, even when they were raping you, it was like you left your body, because it was like, you just knew that it was your death. It was like you said, \"Okay, don't even fight because that you set this up.\" At the same time, you were so angry at yourself, it was like you just really split with your consciousness, and also at the same time, it was terrible. The thing is, that in that lifetime, you did really mean, it was like you did speak up, and you did start this whole process that you're into now.\n\nThe thing you have to realize, though, is that every once in a while, that part of you is so fearful of what you're going to say, because of what happened. The thing you have to realize is that, that fear you experience, yes, it's a real fear, and yes, it does happen, but it's not going to happen to you in this lifetime. The reason why you fear it so much, is because it did already happen to you.\n\nThat feeling, that victim part of you that says, \"Oh, you'll get it.\" If you stand up and you expect the truth, and you really communicate the truth, and you really are who you are, well, you're going to get it. There's no way you're going to escape it, because it's going to happen to you. You have to realize that, that is not a premonition, Cherrie. That is a memory.</html>",

An important way for you to allow yourself to communicate what you have to communicate, is to realize that you do have to release that victim part of you. You have to let her go, because she's the one that gets so scared. Yet, it's like, it's okay to say to her, \"Look, you don't have to do this anymore. You can become pure energy, and give me the light. I'll carry it as a torch. I promise you, I'll do what you wanted to do in that lifetime you couldn't do.\"\n\nIt's like really making a commitment to yourself, to your destiny, and when you make that commitment, totally, not just partially, but totally, then the fear will disappear. That's just such an incredible energy for you. I think that's what I have to say for now. [chuckles] In a way, it might have been good that we didn't have all that much time, because I feel like your chart is just so heavy, it's just so intense, that it's almost like, it's too much to go through all at once. Also, because it's just-- There's so much. I feel like I could talk about your chart for hours and hours and hours. Like I said, I feel like I've just scratched the surface. I feel like I said the things that I felt would be most important to say at this time.</html>",
