These are the original home positions. Are most people here familiar with the tarot? Raise your hand if you're pretty familiar with the Tarot or you work with the Tarot. About half and half. Well, the Tarot cards, this particular deck is the Crowley deck, the flow deck, the Egyptian deck that this article is based upon, except that you can use this spread with any of the decks and it works equally as well. Now, the layout that I have here is the home position of the spread.\n\nThere are nine cards, and I put the card in the position that is the home position. By that, I mean that if you get a card in that position, then you're pretty much on target. I'll explain to you what each position means in this way, but first of all, this is the fool; this is the number zero. This is the first card. This is the last card in the major Arcana. There are 22 major Arcana cards. Well, there's one through 21 and the zero. The zero is both the beginning and the ending. The fool is completeness; the fool is wholeness. I like the fool card a lot, and we're going to use the fool card because the fool symbolizes the excitement, the wonder, the curiosity, the joy at beginning, any journey. This is a journey.</html>",

Now the fool's just really happy and joyous, having a good time, looking everything, and gets off on everything. Gets off on rocks, flowers and just very wide-eyed, innocent. It doesn't have any conditioning, no preconceived notions, or anything. Just totally open to what happens. We're the fool, and we're going down into the subconscious.\n\nWell, actually, before we get down there, the first person that we meet is the magician, the magus, the number one card. This is Mercury, the wing god and the messenger. Now the magician is memory, in this case, the messenger from the gods, the messenger from our deep-down dream self. The magician does the footwork for the high priestess, the hierophant, and the hermit. This is memory. When we wake up with a memory of a dream, it's because of the magician. Magician has brought the memory to us. Magician's always busy running back down, run back up again. Back down, up again. When you say, \"I want to remember a dream.\" It's the magician's job to bring the dream to your awareness.</html>",

It's necessary. She's got a mask over her eyes, and it's necessary for us to take her mask and put it over our eyes and look within in order to get the dream message. Very introspective. Also, observe on the card all the blue and green spears floating above her head. These are like dreams floating up there, waiting to come into consciousness.

Further down, right below the adjustment card, we encounter the chariot card. This is the tool. This is the action that we need to take. This is what the dream is telling us that this is our work, this is what we need to do, or else it's a mirror of what we're actually doing with what's taking place. The chariot is a very action-oriented card, and the chariot is encouraging us to take a chance, plunge right in, and just dive right down into the dream and confront ourselves, confront things about ourselves that may not be very nice or we don't want to see.\n\nIn order to protect ourselves, put on the gold armor that the chariot has on. You feel a little bit protected because it's scary going down into the dream, but use the armor to protect you. The tool, the chariot position, is telling you this is the action. This is what's got to be done. This is why you have the dream. This is the message, and this is what you have to do about it in the awake world. Take the action, and we come up with the number six card. This is the lover's card. Now the lover's card is the reward card.\n\nIf you take the actio. Now, what better reward than to give and receive love in a balanced way from the highest part of ourselves? The more balanced we are within, on an emotional love level, the more we're apt to draw towards us. Someone else who is equally balanced. In the context of dreaming, this balance can also be expressed as receptivity to the dream, followed by the application of the dream content. This is the reward position. It's like whatever comes up in this position, if you do that effectively, whatever comes up in this position will be the reward then.</html>",

Magician comes to her and says, \"So and so would really like a dream tonight about what's going on between her and her boyfriend.\" The high priestess says, \"She won't pay attention anyway. Nothing, go away,\" or \"Okay. Well, she's been pretty good lately. She's been paying attention to her dream, so we'll give her one.\" Then, instead of some magician back with a dream, she's the one. She makes all the biggie decisions. She's the one to talk to at night.\n\nWhen you want to know a particular answer to a particular question, problem, or something, talk to the high priestess within yourself and make friends with her.\n\nThe more attention we give to the high priestess, the easier it is to remember our dreams. The card in this position indicates what we're receiving from the dream world, the overall theme of the dream. Now, I'll go back over in more detail exactly what the positions mean after I get through with this little fairytale that I'm having fun with. Right below the high priestess is the number five card, which is the hierophant. Now, hierophant represents what we're learning through the dream message, very much connected to the eight positions.\n\nThe hierophant and the high priestess are partners. They get together, and they hold council on each of us and decides. While the high priestess decides what dream material to send us, the hierophant is responsible for the dream interpretation. He's the teacher, he's the counselor of dreams. We call upon him for help in interpreting our dreams. The card in this position symbolizes what we're learning from the dream. If you're having difficulty in interpreting your dreams, call upon the hierophant within you because he/she, when I say he/she, I don't mean gender, just energy. The hierophant is more of a dynamic energy.\n\nThe high priestess is more of a receptive type energy, but the hierophant is like the spiritual teacher, the spiritual guide, and well, he's pompous sometimes. He likes for you to go to him and ask for interpretations because he likes to show off his knowledge. Because he has a lot of knowledge. Just talk to your hierophant.</html>",

The emperor shows us that the only way that we can love and nourish ourselves and others is to be true to ourselves. This means that we respect and love ourselves in the same way that we love and respect other people.\n\nIn actuality, what this position teaches us is how are we loving ourselves and others? How are we respecting ourselves and others? How are we giving? How are we receiving? How balanced are we in that aspect? How much are we getting back from what we give out? How are we giving out? Right below the empress, the emphasis partner down there is the emperor, the number four card. Now, the emperor is the pioneer, the builder, the doer, the visionary, and the dream spread.\n\nThe emperor takes what the hierophant teaches about the dream message and applies it to our daily world, our awake world. It's like the action that we take in the outer world. It's like the high priestess is more or less what's going on, on an emotional level.

The hermit takes you on your journey, guides you, and protects you. Totally protects you. We trust the hermit because he wears the full burgundy cloak, which means that he's totally true to himself, totally true to his inner light and love, and helps us to be true to ourselves. To follow a path which is uniquely our own. There's a close working relationship between the hermit and the high priestess.</html>",

It might be to a spiritual temple for advanced teaching, or he could take us into a nightmare to look at some aspect about ourselves, but we're always protected. The hermit is always there, taking care of us, watching over us, and never leaves us alone. That's why we shouldn't be afraid of dreams or nightmares because we're always protected. When it's through, when it's time to come back, the hermit puts the lantern up again, takes us by the hand, and leaves us very gently back up through our subconscious to our awake state.\n\nAs we look at the hermit card down at the bottom, there's a three-headed jackal. Two heads are going forward, and one head is turned backwards. This represents the way in which the hermit uses our past in some of our dreams. He may take us to our past or past situations to teach us about a lesson that's happening in our life right now. Oh, on the card in the back here, people are familiar with the card. It'd be impossible for anybody to see it, so don't even try. There's just a little, teeny, teeny tiny patch of blue. The back behind some of the darker background there. That symbolizes the conscious world when the hermit is taking us back into consciousness, back into the safety of our awake world.\n\nWe experienced the sensation of being guided from the dream world to the waking world by a trusted servant. An ancient soul has been doing this since the beginning of time and will do it to the end of time. Any card in this last position shows what has been handled or completed on a subconscious level during the sleep. What has been completed, what has been handled in some way that we may not be aware of consciously. Now I'll go back and explain a little bit more precisely what the positions mean. You notice I created a spread, and I still have to look at my own notes. The magician, the very first position up here. That's what I already know about the situation when I'm awake. That's what I'm consciously aware of. I already know about that before I even have a dream. It's like my knowledge surrounding the situation. Of course, I won't think about it 'til I have a dream and then I put it all together.</html>",
